        <p>This page provides an overview of the Discovery Data Model and specifies the requirements that a common data model must meet.</p>
        <h2 class="numbered">Common Data Model overview</h2>
        <p>The Common Data Model has an open and transparent design, includes a wide breadth of data types, and is human readable.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Objectives</h3>
        <p>The Common Data Model enables you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of health data held  in an individual’s health record.</li>
            <li class="bullets">visualise and easily understand the types of data held across a population.</li>
            <li class="bullets">apply a query at both an individual and a population level so that the  query definition can be shared, scrutinised, and reused across a number of different implementations.</li>
            <li class="bullets">rapidly design and implement systems that store and access health data that is derived from multiple source systems from both the individual and population health perspective.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">How?</h3>
        <p>The Common Data Model is key to  achieving the objectives by enabling other software applications to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">provide visual representations of health data held  in an individual’s health record.</li>
            <li class="bullets">provide model navigation including conventional folder based navigation or node/ graph navigation with free text search support.</li>
            <li class="bullets">provide a multi-taxonomy approach to categorising data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Common Data Model also supports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">constrained and simple query definitions through associated data points.</li>
            <li class="bullets">links to summary statistics to give insights into likely query results prior to the execution of queries.</li>
            <li class="bullets">user defined views - from a wizard based approach to simple, or advanced, queries.</li>
            <li class="bullets">end users to specify data extract requirements using database query languages, including graph based, in query arguments.</li>
            <li class="bullets">many record store technologies such as relational, column based, or graph based.</li>
            <li class="bullets">a library of predefined query definitions and related artefacts such as code sets, which can be distributed and accessed independently of other technologies.</li>
            <li class="bullets">sharing of query logic across any community regardless of whether or not the queries are applied to model conformant record stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">What it isn't</h3>
        <p>The Common Data Model is not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">a proposed standard for storing or communicating electronic health records.<br /><b>Note:</b> The model organises data that has been stored; the categorisation is determined by information requirements and attribute patterns in the submitted data.</li>
            <li class="bullets">a semantic ontology - the model is semantically passive.<br /><b>Note:</b> The model does include ontologies but it is the responsibility of the source ontology, such as Snomed-CT to make sure that the meanings of the concepts are consistent.</li>
            <li class="bullets">a proposed approach to entering or displaying data.<br /><b>Note:</b> the model recognises and categorises the patterns created when data is entered.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">Why?</h3>
        <p>Approaches to modelling data vary and change over time. There is no consensus as to the way forward yet. From time to time, particular health services elect to use particular standards for particular purposes for a period of time. Standards evolve and new versions have to be supported; this is a continuous evolution.</p>
        <p>It is generally accepted that there is no prospect of even one <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">country </span>converging to a common model of health data and information any time soon. Population health also requires access to environmental, social, and economic data; there is likewise no accepted standard for data across these other domains.</p>
        <p>Many argue that even if there was a common model, there is a need for innovation and new formats will be needed. Therefore the emphasis has been on systems being able to communicate with other systems via standard message formats.</p>
        <p>More recently people have come to understand that there has to be a shared understanding of how data is stored and processed within systems (at least logically).  There is a greater acceptance that there could be a shared  representation of data across a particular communicating community.</p>
        <p>In answer to the question as whether to have yet another data model, the choices are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a candidate standard already in use and adopt it.</li>
            <li>Select a candidate standard, modify it and adopt it.</li>
            <li>Design and implement a new approach either from the ground up or derived from one or more standards.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The option selected will be determined by the requirements. Therefore requirements must be specified in advance of the decision.</p>
        <p>The following section lists requirements for a common data model.</p>
        <h2 class="numbered">Requirements</h2>
        <p><b>Important:</b> The words <i>must</i> and <i>will</i> imply mandatory requirements.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Scope</h3>
        <p>A common data model must support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">Personal health record data; originally received from care management systems (professional or citizen based).
</li>
            <li class="bullets">Personal health record structures; to be presented clearly when accessed by an other software application.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Population health data; including genotypic, phenotypic, disease, environmental, social, and economic factors. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">Governance and consent</h3>
        <p>The data model must include personal consent, governance, and record ownership policies.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The implementation of those policies, during query or data access, is not part of the data model.</p>
        <p><b>Important:</b> Any interpretation of records must take account of governance and consent in addition to interpreting data model queries.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Breadth of model</h3>
        <p>The data model must encompass the (historically separate categories) of model data that are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">Definitions of the structure of health record entries and the relationships between the entries as envisaged for the purposes of holding individuals record.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Definitions of health record data entries and their relationships envisaged for the purposes of analysing populations.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Terminologies, taxonomies, or ontologies and their relationship  to the structures when used in records.</li>
            <li class="bullets">Data sets, code sets, and query definitions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">International terminologies</h3>
        <p>The model must incorporate the following international taxonomies and ontologies, including the semantic definitions and relationships defined within these ontologies together with their definitional relationships:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">Snomed-CT</li>
            <li class="bullets">DM+D</li>
            <li class="bullets">Read 2 and Read 3</li>
            <li class="bullets">ICD10</li>
            <li class="bullets">OPCS-4</li>
            <li class="bullets">PRSB record standards</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">Structure based standards</h3>
        <p>The model must reflect data that has been submitted from systems that support the following structural constructs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">HL7 FHIR STU4 resources and resource profiles</li>
            <li class="bullets">ISO 13606-1, 13606-2</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">NHS standard messages</h3>
        <p>Subject to mapping (human) resource availability, the model must accept inbound data and provide outbound data in the following NHS standard formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">HL7 V2 ADT</li>
            <li class="bullets">HL7 FHIR (STU 2 and above)</li>
            <li class="bullets">NHS Data Dictionary (CDS)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="numbered">Proprietary system taxonomies</h3>
        <p>The model must support proprietary taxonomies and local coding schemes that are relevant to the health data provided by the community.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Other documented message definitions</h3>
        <p>Subject to mapping (human) resource availability and legitimate mapping potential, the model must accept inbound data and provide outbound data in documented message formats including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>openEHR archetype based messages</li>
            <li>System supplier documented message or file output formats</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="numbered">Textual representation of the model</h3>
        <p>The model must be able to be rendered, in part, in a textual format that is understandable by a health informatician without recourse to advanced tools other than simple viewers. Those viewers  include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Plain text viewers</li>
            <li>XML or JSON viewers</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The model is likely to be vast and it will be impractical to present the entire model as a text document. However, a description of an item or a structure or a definition of a structure must be able to be understood by an informatician when represented in text.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Representation of the model</h3>
        <p>It must be practical for a user  to visualise and understand the model data in both a diagrammatic form, for example a  node graph, or navigable text based form via a web application.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Record store independence/dependence</h3>
        <p>It must be possible to access a data model independently of any record stores; the data model itself provides a model of any store that might use it. This  instance of the data model is disconnected.</p>
        <p>It must be possible for entries in a particular record store to directly reference entries in an data model both for query and display.</p>
        <p>Likewise it must be possible for an application to be able to access an data model together with a record store that references it concurrently. This instance of the data model is connected.</p>
        <p>It must be possible for several record stores to reference the same data model instance.</p>
        <h3 class="numbered">Meta model</h3>
        <p>Operating alongside a record store (connected model) , the model must support information query at the level of  a population defined by users who are using an application that accesses the data model directly or via APIs.</p>
        <p>The following is included as an example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A researcher is interested in analysing people with anaemia and their presenting haemoglobin level, for example how anaemic were they before they are diagnosed? The initial question might be:</p>
            <p>“For our local patients with anaemia, what was their lowest haemoglobin level?”</p>
            <p>This is a seemingly simple question. But in fact it is quite complex. The blood test may have been done before the diagnosis or after, or  both. The patient may have received a blood transfusion and the levels may be normal even though they were very low just a few hours  earlier. Likewise the Hb level may have been normal only to suddenly drop and the lowest level recorded only after the diagnosis.  That means that the enquirer needs to make a judgement as to which Hb level is the one that counts. What this question might really mean is:</p>
            <p>“For our local patients with anaemia, what was the lowest level of haemoglobin around the time of the diagnosis?”</p>
            <p>It is important to relate the haemoglobin to the anaemia diagnosis, so a time based judgement may be needed. This might lead to a further refinement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="bullets">Find patients with a condition of anaemia and, </li>
                <li class="bullets">For each patient find the lowest haemoglobin value where the haemoglobin measurement date is between 1 month before and 1 month after the anaemia onset date.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore the model should contain the descriptions and definitions of the concepts that make up these, and other, questions.</p>
            <h3 class="numbered">Identification of misfiled data</h3>
            <p>It must be possible for users, reviewing an data model associated with a record store, to identify data that does not fit with the model’s specification.</p>
            <p>The data model must identify data stored in the records that do not match the expected attribute values.</p>
            <p>For example, A GP might record 'admitted to hospital' as an observation with an observed concept code. The model might model this concept as a historical record of a care event. Therefore the 'admitted to hospital' code could be said to be misfiled.</p>
            <p>The data model should enable users to easily see that 'admitted to hospital' is present within an observation even though it does not fit with the value type of an observation concept.</p>
            <h3 class="numbered">Manual and automated maintenance</h3>
            <p>It must be possible to both manually maintain the data model and automatically maintain it from the following sources:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Scheduled import of terminologies, taxonomies or ontologies.</li>
                <li>On filing of health data into the record store from systems deemed to have reached a level of quality in respect of the data held in them.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>
